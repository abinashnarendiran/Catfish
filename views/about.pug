      p
        | We are a passionate and motivated team dedicated to disrupting the dating industry.  For years the industry has performed subpar service reactively, by connecting couples after they have had no luck. When was the last time you used a dating service without any luck?
      p
        | At Catfish we are focused on transitioning the industry to predictive maintenance. Basically identifying what you need to be in a relationship suitable for you. It's such a simple concept but the impact has market changing implications.
      p
        | What this means is mitigating relationship breakdowns, hazardous communications, future quality dates, environmental impact and a better dating experience. The sum of this impact eludes to ZERO in cost for the individual as we are non-profit.
      p
        | Catfish is more than a platform it is a cultural shift in the way we think about dating services. Technology is at our core, driving value to the industry is what we do.
